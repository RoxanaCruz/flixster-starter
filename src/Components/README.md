### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in my lab ere relevamnt to my project, I would've liked to do more useaffect review as i had some trouble implementing useaffect to fetch api's.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would add more responsive features and css to make website more modernized.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt more confident in today's presentation. I was more sure of my code and work i needed to improve or work on.
